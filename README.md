# Sorting-Visualizer
**A web-based project developed to provide a visual representation of various sorting algorithms.**

The Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is a web-based project developed using _**JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**_. The main goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, enabling users to better understand how these algorithms work.

The featutures of this project are:

* _**Algorithm Selection**_: Users can choose from a list of popular sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort. The selection can be made through the options present on the screen.

* _**Data Input**_: Users have the flexibility to input a random array of numbers for sorting by generating a random array of their size.. This allows users to experiment with different sizes of arrays and observe how the algorithms handle them.

* _**Visualization**_: The project provides a visually appealing representation of the sorting process. Each step of the algorithm is displayed on the screen, showing how the elements move and interact during the sorting process. Visual cues, such as color-coded elements or animations, can be incorporated to enhance the understanding of the sorting algorithms.

* _**Speed Control**_: The Sorting Algorithms Visualizer offers the ability to control the speed of the visualization. Users can adjust the speed according to their preference, allowing them to observe the sorting process at different rates. This feature helps users analyze and compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms.

## To use the Project and the steps of setting-up :

* Download the zip file and unzip the folder in your local system.
* Open the `index.html` file and you are ready to use the project.
